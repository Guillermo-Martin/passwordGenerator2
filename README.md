# Password Generator

<!-- https://guillermo-martin.github.io/passwordGenerator/

## Description

The app generates a password between 8 and 128 characters. When a user presses the "Generate Password" button, a series of prompts will be given to the user. These prompts ask how long the user would like their password and if they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters in their password. Using these prompts, a password will be generated that meets the user's desired length and desired criteria. The app will then display an alert with a randomly generated password meeting the user's desired criteria. The password will also be printed out onto the text area.

## Technologies
* Languages, frameworks, various tools
    * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Challenges
* Your experience building this app
    * I had ups and downs building the app.  There were times when I was proud of myself for coming up with certain aspects of the code on my own, such as creating the functions and determining some of the logic.  There were also some frustrating times when I felt like I had an idea and when I tried to execute it, it wouldn't work.
* What was difficult
    * One of the difficult parts of this homework, I thought, was trying to loop through all of the character generator functions a certain number of times.  Depending on the user's desired password length, the loop would repeat that many times, but then would provide a password that didn't meet the user's desired length.
* What did you learn
    * I learned about "NaN", using while loops, and to focus on one issue at a time.
    * I also learned to break problems down into smaller problems and tackle those smaller problems first. 
    * I also learned that using alerts was a good way of troubleshooting my code.
* How did you go about solving a problem
    * To solve a problem, I would write down what the problem was, and ask myself questions on how to accomplish it.  I would then write down each idea and then tackle each idea one at a time.
    * I also used the console and alerts to help me see any issues I was having.
    * I also would Google things and attend office hours.
